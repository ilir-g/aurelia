# Aurelia

Tech Stack:
* Aurelia Framework (Frontend)
* .Net5 (Backend)

This project demonstrate CRUD operations using .net core and aurelia framework.

## Back-End Development Workflow
To run .net5 you should have installed .net core sdk 5. Afterwards, open web API source code and type cmd, run the following commands:
```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

With the first command we will be sure that all packges are restored. And then we run application with dotnet run, to see it open on a browser (https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.chtml)
## Front-End Development Workflow
To run the frontend app open source code and run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
After these commands open a web browser and type https://localhost:8080
